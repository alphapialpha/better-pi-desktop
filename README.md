Perform a fresh install of _Raspberry Pi OS Lite_ and boot up the system, go through basic setup (language / keyboard). Then execute:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphapialpha/better-pi-desktop/refs/heads/main/gnome-install.sh -o install-sh
sh install.sh

It will update the system and perform an installation of _GNOME_ with _GDM_ and install a performance optimized Chromium as a webbrowser. That's it! The rest is up to you...
Enjoy!
