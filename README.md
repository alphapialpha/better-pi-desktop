# Better-Pi-Desktop  
Automatically install a minimal desktop environment (GNOME, GDM, and hardware-accelerated Chromium) on Raspberry Pi OS Lite.

### Steps:
1. Start with a fresh install of _Raspberry Pi OS Lite_ and boot up the system. Complete the basic setup (language, keyboard, user).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphapialpha/better-pi-desktop/main/install.sh | bash
   ```
3. That's it!

The script will update your system, install _GNOME_ with _GDM_, and set up a performance-optimized version of _Chromium_ as your web browser.  
The rest is up to you.

**Enjoy!**
